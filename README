	*** DragonFly porting of conky system monitor ***

Relevant changes from mainstream:

*   Collapse processes() and running_processes() implemetation.

    All funtionalities using kern.proc sysctl get grouped together
    as in this case (at least) sysctl doesn't deal good with related
    successive calls (first to determine size of object returned,
    then to get the object self) from different threads.

*   Use kern.proc.all_lwp instead of kern.proc.all

    Without lwp info it's possible that running processes count is 0
    (which clearly can't be). This is what we want too, as lwps are
    what in the end cause system load.

*   Add dfly specific kern.version substr (see dfly conkyrc sample)

I'm using it since months, it's running stable; but watch out: even though
showed values seem reasonable, i'm not 100% sure they are correct.
